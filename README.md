# canvideo
![Canvideo Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChocolateLoverRaj/canvideo/better/package/icons/icon.png)

An open-source tool for Node.js that can make animations and generate videos.

The idea of this was to create animations and then render a video out of it. The coolest part about it is the logo that I made. It is a hand-written SVG logo.
